# Nema-17-Blind-System
I made my own system, for controling window blinds, using **Nema 17** stepper motor, and **a4988** stepper driver.
Design involves 3d printing, and making homemade pcb, or just using unviersal one.
Blinds can be easly controlled either by buttons or external hardware. PCB has 5 pins coming out of it, which has all the voltages and button pins coming in to microcontroller.
To connect motor to the pcb i used 2mm goldpins, because my motor has this type of connector.
You can drive blinds using gearbox, it depends on how heavy your blinds are, or how strong is your motor.
Design uses M3 screws to assembly everything. I didn't put points for screwing the pcb so you can attach it anyway you want
